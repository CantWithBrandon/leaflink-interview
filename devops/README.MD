# Dev Ops Interview Flow

## DevOps Phone Screen

* Tell them a little about the company, the specific needs of the role, and what they would be working on Week 1. 

* Answer any questions they have

## Take Home


* Given a  webapp (attached as zip) that needs to connect to a DB, create a docker-compose or other orchestration file that will allow the webapp to talk to these services in a portable env. If you choose not to use an orchestration file, explain how you would otherwise connect them in a portable way, why this is a superior approach, and how you would scale it.

*  Deliverable: a zip or otherwise compressed file. This file MUST include take_home.py and it MUST include a README.MD that will explain how to run this app so it works.

 

## DevOps in-person interview 

### Engineering 

* "Simple" problem about log parsing: given this log of requests made to our server, we need to find and count up all instances of a certain API request. At first, just a simple awk/sed/grep solution, but then introduce considerations like making sure we don't include requests from own servers, requests from bots, etc

* This can be a whiteboarding algo thing that turns into an extended discussion (where do the logs come from, can we do analytics as the logs come in rather than post-hoc, etc)

* Discussion about previous roles, how they worked in a team 

### HR / Biz

* Culture fit, chillness, focus on instances where they took charge and had to learn a lot of new stuff at once

### Michael / Zach follow up
* Discuss answers to take home questions, what they want out of the role, where they want to take their career / skills
* Discuss past roles, what they liked, what they didn't
* General brain picking about tech, get a feel for how they operate

### Talk with Ryan / Zach

### Final decision 
* Yes
* No
* There are no other choices
