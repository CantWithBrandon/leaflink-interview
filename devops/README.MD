# Dev Ops Interview Flow

## DevOps Phone Screen

* Tell them a little about the company, the specific needs of the role, and what they would be working on Week 1. 

* Answer any questions they have

## Take Home


* Given a  webapp (attached as zip) that needs to connect to a DB, create a docker-compose or other orchestration file that will allow the webapp to talk to these services in a portable env. If you choose not to use an orchestration file, explain how you would otherwise connect them in a portable way, why this is a superior approach, and how you would scale it.

*  Deliverable: a zip or otherwise compressed file. This file MUST include take_home.py and it MUST include a README.MD that will explain how to run this app so it works.

 

## DevOps in-person interview 

### Engineering 

* DevOps (Michael + 1 other eng) - Build upon the take home problem: how would you deploy it? Scale it? Maintain it?

* Backend (2 BE devs) - High level discussion of what it would take to implement a logging system. Given a simple app that logs a message everytime it completes an action (such as e.g. updating user info), what would an ideal system look like for logging these messages, storing them, searching them, and connecting them to incidents and traces? There should be a fair amount of whiteboarding and diagramming but this is *not* a coding exercise nor should they be expected to write lots of code

### HR / Biz

* Culture fit, chillness, focus on instances where they took charge and had to learn a lot of new stuff at once

### Michael / Zach follow up
* Discuss answers to take home questions, what they want out of the role, where they want to take their career / skills
* Discuss past roles, what they liked, what they didn't
* General brain picking about tech, get a feel for how they operate

### Talk with Ryan / Zach

### Final decision 
* Yes
* No
* There are no other choices
